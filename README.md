# Intentional Team Building

How do you build effective teams? What are the determining factors? In this collaborative workshop we will explore how to identify the values underpinning your team dynamics and explore techniques to cultivate effective teams built around intentional values.

### More About This Workshop
This workshop is built around the experience and journey that the instructional teams at the Turing School are on to cultivate healthy and effective teams capable of achieving world-class results. Co-facilitated by the directors of the front-end and backend programs at Turing, participants will  benefit from the varied experiences and insight gleaned from their past and present experiences of working to build a variety of technical teams.

This workshop will employ the same teaching techniques utilized by Turing to engage students, including culturally responsive teaching that enables participants to incorporate their background and experiences into their exploration of this topic which will result in deeper understanding of the practical application of the workshop content.
