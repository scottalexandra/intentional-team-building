# Turing School Case Study: Instructional Team Values

## Background
* Turing is a non-profit, fully remote, 7-month developer training program.
* The mission of Turing is to unlock human potential by training a diverse and inclusive student body for high fulfillment technical careers.
* The program consists of 4 6-week long modules with a one week intermission in between each module.
* Turing hires instructors who are former industry professionals, former students or both.
* Student success is the primary focus of Turing's work.

## Instructor Responsibilities
* During a typical week, an instructor will carry out the following activities:
  * Lesson prep and teaching classes
  * Providing technical feedback in small group project check-ins
  * Non-technical 1:1s with students aka ‘squishies’
  * Facilitating and grading technical assessments
  * Working with students to troubleshoot and debug code
* Instructors control the curriculum and set the schedule. They have full agency to modify lessons and projects based on trends in student outcomes and student feedback.
* To aid in student success, instructors leverage the entire Turing community including:
  * A highly engaged alumni community
  * A Formal mentorship program matching students with industry professionals, often alums
  * A ‘Rock and Pebble’ program that matches students in the second half of the program to share knowledge and provide assistance to students early in the program.
* Instructors participate in roundtable discussions with industry professionals who have hired or worked with Alumni in order to gain insight into how to improve the curriculum.
* During intermission weeks instructors are not expected to be online

## Paid Leave and Professional Development Benefits
* Instructors have a flexible leave policy and are encouraged to take a minimum of 15 days off per year.
* Instructors receive an annual professional development stipend of $1200 to use how they see fit.

## Instructional values
We believe that all students deserve:
* A culture of inquiry built upon a safe, trusting environment where students can take risks, be vulnerable, and ask for help
* Accountability to achieve a high standard for technical and professional performance
* Constant critique that both articulates potential for growth and celebrates progress
* Conscious collaboration that pushes them to get the most from and do the most for their pairs and teams
* A sense of belonging through meaningful and supportive connections to students, alumni, and staff


## Observed Instructor Behavior
* Instructors enjoy working with students and find fulfillment in seeing students learn and apply challenging technical concepts.
* Instructors prioritize building strong connections and rapport with students.
* If a student is experiencing difficulties after hours an instructor is willing to jump on a call with that student to provide some support and assistance
* Some instructors were open to the idea of professional development but felt that any time in their work day set aside for PD was usually spent helping students work through unexpected issues.
* A few instructors did not see the value in prioritizing professional development time citing that ‘working with students should always take priority’.
* Instructors are often iterating on the curriculum based on recent student feedback.
* Once an instructor is familiar with the curriculum they are not regularly writing code.
* At the end of the work day some instructors have conveyed feeling mentally and emotionally spent and don’t have the energy to continue working on technical growth.
